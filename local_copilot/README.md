# Local Copilot extension example

This repository contains sample code for running a vscode extension that completes and summarizes code.
This code was made for the purpose of a presentation and is not fully featured so buggs are expected. The back-end relies on a REST server. During the presentation this was run inside GoogleColab (for a completely local solution this can be run inside a docker container).

For initial setup and installation this [medium](https://medium.com/@rmmmsy/your-first-visual-studio-code-extension-ce8e040ba8ca) tutorial was used together with [microsofts](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension).
